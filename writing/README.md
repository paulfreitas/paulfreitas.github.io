# Writing Samples
Here are a few of my writing samples related to technical writing.

I wrote:
* Part III (chapters 12 and 13) of Charlie Calvert's [_Kylix Developer's Guide_](./SAMS%20Kylix%20Developers%20Guide.pdf) for SAMS Publishing
* ["HTML5 for Audio Applications"](./HTML5%20for%20Audio%20Applications.pdf) for Linux Journal (February 2012)
* two lab manuals for [Physics 111](./111%20Lab%20Manual.pdf) and [Physics 112](./112%20Lab%20Manual.pdf) courses I taught as an adjunct physics professor at Boise State University
